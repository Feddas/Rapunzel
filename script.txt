rapunzel:
Hi, I'm rapunzel. little girls love me after watching me in disney moves.
A little butterfly told me I should find a unicorn around here. See if you can help me walk and jump around to find him.

rapunzel:
Why hello little camelion.
camelion:
Hi, I'm here because I'm supposed to be your friend from the movie.
rapunzel:
Since disney is sure to prefer it, you best join me in my adventure to find the unicorn.
camelion:
great

(before a hard jump)
camelion: this looks like a tricky jump, you sure you've got this.
rapunzel: yeah, should only take a few thousand tries.

(after a hard jump)
camelion: you did it.

(after failing a jump)
camelion: id give you gold for effort, but I can't change that color.

rapunzel: I hear there is a unicorn in this cave
chamelion: How could a unicorn fit in there?
rapunzel: unicorns have little legs they can use like sleds.
chamelion: there is no way that's true, you're making that up.
butterfly: it's true, I smelled unicorn body order coming out of there just the other day.
rapunzel: let's go, then!
chamelion: someone should scout out ahead to map out the way
butterfly: With my expert sense of smell, I will.
rapunzel: I love you guys(weeping tears of joy)
chamelion: To the unicorn!
